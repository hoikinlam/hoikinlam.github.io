            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Hoikin Lam. I'm a 3rd year computer science transfer from Santa Monica College. I was born in Hong Kong, China but moved to USA when I was 8.</p>
            <p>Some things I like to do is play video games, seek thrills, and experience new things. I also like to eat... <strong>a lot.</strong> Some games I play are league, tft, valorant, and whatever my friends play as I don't typically play solo. </p>>
